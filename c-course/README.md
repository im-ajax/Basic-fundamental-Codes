in your vs code, you have to install an extension named code runner. then go to the settings and search for executor map and then copy all the texts from the configuration file and paste it into the (settings.json) and hit ctrl + s (if you dont have the autosave feature).

you need to get vs code installed and gitbash according to your computer <br>
if your computer is x64 or x86 then download it according to your device.
